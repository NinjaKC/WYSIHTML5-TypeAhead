WYSIHTML5-TypeAhead
===================

<h3>[I WILL RELEASE THIS AS SOON AS I HAVE CONFIRMATION FROM THE CLIENT]<h3/>

This is a plugin that integrated Twitter's TypeAhead jQuery Plugin, with the WYSIHTML5 Editor. It allows you to type @anything in the WYSIHTML5 Editor, and have Twitter's TypeAhead Dropdown repond with what comes after the @ symbol. It has been tested and re-tested, email me if you find a bug or have questions.
